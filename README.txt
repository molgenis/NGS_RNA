Gene expression quantification
The trimmed fastQ files where aligned to build 37 human reference genome using STAR 2.3.1 [1] allowing for 2 mismatches. 
Before gene quantification SAMtools 0.1.18 [2] was used to sort the aligned reads. 
The gene level quantification was performed by HTSeq-0.5.4 [3] using --mode=union --stranded=no and,
Ensembl version 71 was used as gene annotation database.
